# CS505 Graduate Students - Group 1: Final Project Component
Our component offers functionality to connect with a suite of sensors and provide the data from each sensor back in a convenient aggregated Map object. 
Users can call getAllSensorData(Map<Integer, SensorType> portsAndSensors), with port numbers for each sensor requests (Integer) and a type using the SensoryType enum as parameters. The output would be a Map object with sensor data stored as individual human-readable variables.
